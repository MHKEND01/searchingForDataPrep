Deaths are organized by age at time of death, ethnicity, sex, causes, year, time and place of death, and county of residence. I’m primarily interested in data related to causes of death and age at time of death. I would hope to highlight what is most likely to kill a given individual at any point in their life. Perhaps accidents are more likely to kill young people, and cancer is more likely to kill old people. It could be interesting to develop tool where users enter their age, and the most common cause of death for people of that age is displayed. Other demographics variables could also be investigated for interesting trends in cause of death, like sex or ethnicity.</p>
<p>The second dataset provides information on cancer rates across age cohorts, sex, and ethnicity for each type of cancer between 2000 and 2006. I would imagine there are clear correlations between different kinds of cancers and age/sex which are widely known. It may be more interesting to investigate if there are differences in cancer rates between ethnicities. Perhaps a mutation is more common in some ethnic groups makes a certain kind of cancer more likely, or perhaps income inequality leads to poorer health and increased cancer risk across the board. A data visualization exploring these potential trends might prove informative.</p>
<p>The third dataset is similar to the first, but focuses specifically on infant mortality. It provides information such as cause of death, birth weight, age, the mother’s county of residence, maternal age, maternal ethnicity and martial status. It may be interesting to investigate correlations between causes of death and maternal age, county of residence, and ethnicity. Perhaps the infants of younger mothers are at risk of different causes of death than the infants of older mothers, or perhaps certain causes of infant death are more prevalent in certain states. Revealing these correlations in a visualization could be interesting to medical professionals. <p></body></html>
